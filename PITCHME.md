@title[how we got here]
#### how we got here...
Since the early 20th century, drones have been used by the military and by **hobbyists**.  
  
For decades, training and operating procedures were driven by community organizations like the **Academy of Model Aeronautics**.  
+++
@title[how we got here]
#### how we got here...
The **AMA** designed training programs for the operation of small model aircraft, which were largely powered by gasoline engines.

#### how we got here...
As the popularity of model aircraft grows, the federal government sees the need to regulate.  
  
@css[fragment](In the mid 2000s, Congress officially acknowledges the community organization training model as best practice for **non-commerical** use...)  
  
@css[fragment](but the Federal Aviation Administration bans commercial use!)

#### how we got here...
The FAA establishes [**Advisory Circular 91-57, Model Aircraft Operating Standards**](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1028086), permitting model aircraft use up to 400ft AGL with the following (voluntary) guidelines...

@ol
- The aircraft is flown strictly for hobby or recreational use 
- The aircraft operates in accordance with a community-based set of safety guidelines and within the programming of a nationwide community-based organization (CBO) 
- The aircraft is limited to not more than 55 pounds 
- The aircraft operates in a manner that does not interfere with, and gives way to, any manned aircraft 
- w/i 5 miles of an airport, the operator of the model aircraft provides the airport operator or ATC with prior notice of the operation

Still no commercial operations!

The need for commercial UAS operations grows, and legal battles between users and the FAA erupt...

##### public COA
To permit limited commercial uas operations, the FAA begins issuing **[Certificates of Waiver or Authorization](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/systemops/aaim/organizations/uas/coa/) (COAs)**.  
  
@css[fragment](COAs can be granted to public organizations for flight in special airspace, or in special situations...)  
  
@css[fragment](A lengthy and rigorous application process limited the issuance of COAs...)@css[fragment](and they typically were issued for a limited duration or area)

Note: 
- COA requires a public sponsor.
- Private company must partner with a public entity.

##### Section 333 Exemptions
Powerful business entities (Amazon anyone?) begin to lobby for clearer and more efficient regulations.  
  
@css[fragment](The FAA Mondernization and Reform Act of 2012 includes Section 333, providing a means for legal commercial operations without a public partner)...  
  
@css[fragment](Section 333 exemptions are more flexible than COAs, with fewer flight area restrictions...)  
  
@css[fragment](But still require a lengthy and cumbersome application process)

Note: 
- Section 333 acts as a temporary solution while the FAA can consider more substantive solutions...eventually leading to Part 107.
