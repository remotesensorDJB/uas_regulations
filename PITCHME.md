Since the early 20th century, drones have been used by the military and by **hobbyists**.  
  
For decades, training and operating procedures were driven by community organizations like the **Academy of Model Aeronautics**.

The **AMA** designed training programs for the operation of small model aircraft, which were largely powered by gasoline engines.

The FAA establishes [**Advisory Circular 91-57, Model Aircraft Operating Standards**](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1028086), permitting model aircraft use up to 400ft AGL with the following restrictions...

- The aircraft is flown strictly for hobby or recreational use 
- The aircraft operates in accordance with a community-based set of safety guidelines and within the programming of a nationwide community-based organization (CBO) 
- The aircraft is limited to not more than 55 pounds 
- The aircraft operates in a manner that does not interfere with, and gives way to, any manned aircraft 
- w/i 5 miles of an airport, the operator of the model aircraft provides the airport operator or ATC with prior notice of the operation
