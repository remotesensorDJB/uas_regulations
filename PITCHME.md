@title[how we got here]
#### how we got here...
Since the early 20th century, drones have been used by the military and by **hobbyists**.  
  
For decades, training and operating procedures were driven by community organizations like the **Academy of Model Aeronautics**.  
+++
@title[how we got here]
#### how we got here...
The **AMA** designed training programs for the operation of small model aircraft, which were largely powered by gasoline engines. 
+++
@title[how we got here]
#### how we got here...
As the popularity of model aircraft grows, the federal government sees the need to regulate.  
  
@css[fragment](In the mid 2000s, Congress officially acknowledges the community organization training model as best practice for **non-commerical** use...)  
  
@css[fragment](but the Federal Aviation Administration bans commercial use!)
+++
@title[how we got here]
#### how we got here...
The FAA establishes [**Advisory Circular 91-57, Model Aircraft Operating Standards**](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1028086), permitting model aircraft use up to 400ft AGL with the following (voluntary) guidelines... 
+++ 
@ol
- The aircraft is flown strictly for hobby or recreational use 
- The aircraft operates in accordance with a community-based set of safety guidelines and within the programming of a nationwide community-based organization (CBO) 
- The aircraft is limited to not more than 55 pounds 
- The aircraft operates in a manner that does not interfere with, and gives way to, any manned aircraft 
- w/i 5 miles of an airport, the operator of the model aircraft provides the airport operator or ATC with prior notice of the operation

Still no commercial operations!
+++

#### how we got here...
The need for commercial UAS operations grows, and legal battles between users and the FAA erupt...

##### public COA
To permit limited commercial uas operations, the FAA begins issuing **[Certificates of Waiver or Authorization](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/systemops/aaim/organizations/uas/coa/) (COAs)**.  
  
@css[fragment](COAs can be granted to public organizations for flight in special airspace, or in special situations...)  
  
@css[fragment](A lengthy and rigorous application process limited the issuance of COAs...)@css[fragment](and they typically were issued for a limited duration or area)

Note: 
- COA requires a public sponsor.
- Private company must partner with a public entity. 
+++

#### how we got here...
##### Section 333 Exemptions
Powerful business entities (Amazon anyone?) begin to lobby for clearer and more efficient regulations.  
  
@css[fragment](The FAA Mondernization and Reform Act of 2012 includes Section 333, providing a means for legal commercial operations without a public partner...)  
  
@css[fragment](Section 333 exemptions are more flexible than COAs, with fewer flight area restrictions...)  
+++  
@css[fragment](But still require a lengthy and cumbersome application process)  
  
@css[fragment](and REQUIRES an FAA licensed pilot of sport rating or higher!)

Note: 
- Section 333 acts as a temporary solution while the FAA can consider more substantive solutions...eventually leading to Part 107. 
- For years, the regulatory landscape is uncertain for small businesses, and for government entities, who were restrcited from pursuing Section 333 exemption. 
- ALL commercial operations require the supervision of an FAA licensed pilot! 
+++
@title[how we got here]
#### how we got here...
##### Part 107
Since June of 2016, [Part 107 of the FAA Code of Federal Restrictions (CFR)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=e331c2fe611df1717386d29eee38b000&mc=true&node=pt14.2.107&rgn=div5) lowers the barriers to entry in the commerical UAS sphere.  
  
@css[fragment](Part 107 defines the operating limitations of small UAS systems under 55lb...)@css[fragment](and establishes the Remote Pilot in Command certification)  
  
@css[fragment](individuals can now seek certification to fly UASes commercially without a lengthy and cumbersome application)

@title[part 107 overview]
### Part 107 Overview 

@ul
- < 55lb
- <= 400ft AGL (or 400ft above structure)
- Not interfere with airport/heliport operations
- Daytime only (30 min before sunrise/30 min after sunset)
- VLOS only
- 3+ miles visibility
@ulend

Note: 
- Let's take a look at the major guidelines of Part 107, and understand how they apply to our operations

+++
@ul
- Yield right of way to manned aircraft
- No flight over non-participating people
- No operations from moving aircraft
- No operations from moving vehicle (unless in a remote area)
- Flight in airspace other than "G" requires ATC **permission**
- Operations supervised by rPIC certificate holder
@ulend

Note: Looking at the Part 107 restrictions, we see a couple of themes emerge...airspace, weather, decision making, airport operations, communications, etc.
---  
@title[part 107 certification]
##### [Part 107: Remote Pilot Certification](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/become_a_drone_pilot/)

@ul
- sUAS regulations
- Airspace Classifications
- Aviation weather
- sUAS loading and performance
- Operations (emergency procedures, crew management, decision-making, airport operations, communications, etc)
-@ulend
---
##### Airspace Classifications
The **National Airspace System** defines the airspace, navigation systems and airports that comprise the aviation infrastructure in the United States.  
  
The atmosphere is divided into a series of airspace classes with unique rules about aircraft operations within them.
+++
##### Airspace Classifications
- **Class A**: A for altitude! 18,000ft MSL and above
- **Class B**: B for busy! Around the nation's busiest airports. (Think JFK/ORD)
- **Class C**: C for crowded! Around major airports, but not the busiest. (Think SDF)
- **Class D**: D for dialog! Around airports with a control tower to talk to. (Think LOU)
- **Class E**: E for everywhere!...that isn't A, B, C, D, or G.
- **Class G**: G for ground! All airspace from the surface to 1,200ft AGL that isn't A, B, C, or D.

##### Airspace Classifications
Where do sUAS fly?  

@css[fragment](Mainly class...)@css[fragment](**G!**)    
  @css[fragment](Up to 400ft AGL)  
@css[fragment](Maybe class...)@css[fragment](**B, C, or D!**)  
  @css[fragment](With ATC permissions)  
@css[fragment](Rarely class...)@css[fragment](**E**!)  
  @css[fragment](If flying around tall structures/uncontrolled airports)  
@css[fragment](Never class...)@css[fragment](**A!**)  
  @css[fragment](Far too high. Breaks VFR and VLOS requirements)

##### Aviation Weather
Part 107 Regulations state that we must have **3 statue miles visibility** in our flight area.  
  
@css[fragment](How can we know in advance what weather conditions to expect?)  
  
@css[fragment](FAA provides two main sources...)  
@ul
- Surface Aviation Weather Observations
- Aviation Weather Reports
@ulend
+++
##### Aviation Weather
##### Surface Aviation Weather Observations
@ul
- ASOS: Automated surface observing system
- AWOS: Automated weather observing system
@ulend
  
@css[fragment](Both are associated with airports facilities...)

##### Airport Operations
Although UAS operations may rarely occur in the vicinity of airports, an knoweldge of airport operations is required for Part 107 certification. 
A chief concern is understanding traffic patterns, and an ability to interpret pilot communications of their position around an airport.  
+++
##### Airport Operations
Pilots will use the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) or universal communications (UNICOM) frequency to call out their position around uncontrolled airports.  
  
You may hear a pilot say...  
@css[fragment](Springfield traffic...Cessna nine six whiskey is entering a left downwind for runway three two...Springfield traffic)  
  
@css[fragment](Based on this information, how do we know that the aircraft is approaching from southwest of the airport?)  
+++
##### Airport Operations
Runways are named by the **runway heading**, or the compass direction pointing down the runway.  
  
![Runway](images/runway_directions.jpg)
+++
##### Airport Operations
All runways share a similar **traffic pattern**, defined by **downwind, base, and final approach legs**  
  
![traffic](images/airport_traffic.png)
+++
##### Airport Operations
Given this information, where is the following airplane?  
  
@css[fragment(Frankfort traffic, Cessna nine six whiskey is turning left base for runway seven...Frankfort traffic)  
  
@css[fragment](The airplane is **west** of the airfield)
